# New Section, Back to H1

Test introducing the next section.

## Repeat the same formatting test

Just to make sure nothing changes in repeat or in a new section.

Text in paragraphs again, to test repetition: **Bold** and *italic* and ***bold italic***. Under line. Don\'t forget ~~strikethrough~~, Superscript in 2<sup>3</sup> and subscript Z<sub>i</sub> and N<sub>b</sub>.

**Make sure bold starting a line isn\'t confused** with a list.

*Make sure italic starting* a line isn\'t confused with a list.
