# Mistune v2 (Modified for the URE Methods Project)

This is a fork of the [Mistune Project (v2)](https://github.com/lepture/mistune).

The original project did not provide support for the MathJax/MathTex Markdown 
dialect and had some idiosyncracies compared to the Markdown supported by 
[OSF](https://osf.io). This fork added a MathJax plugin along with some 
additional features, but it was not merged into the source repo. 
Mistune v3 has since been released, which has signficant and breaking changes
compared to v2. 

The standalone forked repository with the MathJax/MathTex plugin is the 
**plugin-mathtex** branch of the repo at 
[https://github.com/krcrouse/mistune](https://github.com/krcrouse/mistune/tree/plugin-mathtex)
